{% include JB/setup %}

The OCCIware aims at building a formal model-driven approach for
managing Everything as a Service.

It is built on 3 pillars:

* A [formal framework]({{ BASE_PATH }}/alloy.html) for OCCI designing based on
[Alloy](http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/) language,

* a [domain specific modeling language]({{ BASE_PATH }}/modeling.html) based on
  [EMF](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/)

* a [deployment framework]({{ BASE_PATH }}/implementation.html) based on
  [erocci](http://jeanparpaillon.github.com/erocci)
