OCCIware aims at building a formal model-driven approach for managing Everything as a Service.

![OCCIware: a formal model-driven approach for managing Everything as a Service]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/OCCIware-big-picture.jpg)

OCCIware is built on 3 pillars:

* A [formal framework]({{ BASE_PATH }}/alloy.html) for OCCI designing based on
[Alloy](http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/),

* a [domain specific modeling language]({{ BASE_PATH }}/modeling.html) based on
  [EMF](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/),

* a [deployment framework]({{ BASE_PATH }}/implementation.html) based on
  [erocci](http://jeanparpaillon.github.com/erocci).

Some OCCI models are also [presented here]({{ BASE_PATH }}/models.html).
